Possible changes. 
Color ram is currently 768 bytes 3 bytes per entry. this would "feel" more retro at RGB555 or RGB444 and use 512 bytes instead.

Blitter currently has a constant output stride of 64 bytes. this could be a register. 

System isn't tied to 6502, could easily support other 8 bit CPU's with minimal changes. Also considered 6309 & Z80.

consider maybe filename extension ? cart.cb2, cart.cb9, cart.cbz etc. 

Things to definately add. 
CC65 template.
Millfork template.
KickAsm template.
